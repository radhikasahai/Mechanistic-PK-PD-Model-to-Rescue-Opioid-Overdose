scripts to generate figure S2 from the supplementary document of Thrasher et al.

Run_IN8_population.sh uses a slurm job array to run all 2001 subjects in parallel. 
It runs the script run_IN8_population.R and each array task index simulates a different subjects

Run_figure_S2_plotting.sh first runs IN8_population_stats.R then runs plot_figure_S2.R

IN8_population_stats.R reads the simulation data for each subject (generated by Run_IN8_population.sh/run_IN8_population.R)
then calculates the mean, sd, and some key quantiles for each time point. Writes them to output/population_stats.RDS

runs plot_figure_S2.R reads the population stats and creates Figure_S2.png

main.sh submits Run_IN8_population.sh then sumbits Run_figure_S2_plotting.sh to be run once the population simulation is finished.
