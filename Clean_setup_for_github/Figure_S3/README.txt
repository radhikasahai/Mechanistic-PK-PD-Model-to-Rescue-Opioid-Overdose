scripts to generate figure S3 from the supplementary document of Thrasher et al.

Running main.R uses the functions in /simulationFunctions to run the each of the PK models with the typical parameters (in ../parameters),
and plots the figure using plotting_function.R

The names of each model directory in /models refer to the structure of the model,
i.e., /oneCompartmentPK_twoTransit is a one-compartment model with two transit compartments

Figure_S3.png is the resulting figure
